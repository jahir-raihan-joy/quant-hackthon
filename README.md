# Our Solution is at solution.ipynb file. 

### <p style="color:orange"> But we're unable to create  condition for selling in the solution.ipynb using "backtesting.py" because  still don't know  how to use it properly .  Moreover because of windows machine, zipline was out of our range.</p>

### That's why we've submitted another file <code>"solution_with_selling_condition_raw.ipynb"</code> , if you may want to debug and run your matrices ,i'll suggest using this file. 
NOTE: <code>solution_with_selling_condition file is raw. You can backtest with other stock data manually.</code>


## Anyway we've explained the strategy in both files.
