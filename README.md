# Our Solution is at solution.ipynb file. 

### But we're unable to create  condition for selling in the solution.ipynb using "backtesting.py" because we're still unware how to use it properly .  Moreover because of windows machine zipline was out of our range.

### That's why we've submitted another file "solution_with_selling_condition_raw.ipynb" , if you may want to debug and run your matrices ,i'll suggest using this file 
NOTE: solution_with_selling_condition is raw.


## Anyway we've explained the strategy in both files.
